**AIOT KITT** is the name of my project initiative, a conceptual AIOT Robot based on the capabilities of NVIDIA Jetson Nano's AI edge computing , JetBot's mobility, and Aerial Drones' alterability/anonymity..., aim at **"Transforming future police security patrols with AIOT".** 

Started from scratch, with total 10+ AIOT courses, 600+ study-hours and months of hands-on experiences, the [AIOT Class 04, Digital Education Institute of iii](https://www.iiiedu.org.tw/aiot/) that I enrolled half an year ago, now become the magic key for me to open the first gate of AIOT world. Stay tuned for more drama.

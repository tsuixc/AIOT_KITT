**AIOT Knight Rider** is the name of my project initiative (AIOT Robot) based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, aiming at **"Transforming future police security patrols with AIOT".** Starting from the scratch, by enrolled in [AIOT Class 04 (Digital Education Institute of iii)](https://www.iiiedu.org.tw/aiot/) with total 10+ AIOT courses, 600+ study-hours and months hands-on experiences, the first gate of AIOT world has being opened up for more adventures.
